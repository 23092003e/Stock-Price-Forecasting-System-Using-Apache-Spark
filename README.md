# Stock Price Forecasting System Using Apache Spark

## Overview

This project is designed to analyze historical stock market data, build predictive models, and deploy a real-time forecasting pipeline using Apache Spark. The primary goal is to assist investors and financial institutions in making informed decisions by providing accurate stock price forecasts.

## Objectives

- **Historical Data Analysis:** Process and analyze historical stock market data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop and train machine learning models using Apache Spark.
- **Real-Time Forecasting:** Deploy a pipeline that offers real-time stock price predictions.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Apache Spark:** Distributed data processing and model training.
- **Python:** Main programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Primary development environment (see `src.ipynb`).
- **Additional Libraries:** Refer to `requirement.txt` for the complete list of required packages.


## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/23092003e/Stock-Price-Forecasting-System-Using-Apache-Spark.git
   cd Stock-Price-Forecasting-System-Using-Apache-Spark


2. **Install the required libraries: Use the following command to install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirement.txt

3. **Run the Project:**
    - Open src.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.
    - Execute the notebook cells in order to preprocess the data, train the models, and generate stock price forecasts.
4. **Results & Evaluation**
   Upon running the project, you will obtain:
    - Real-time stock price forecasts.
    - Visualizations and performance metrics that evaluate the model's accuracy.
    - Insights derived from the analysis of historical stock market data.
